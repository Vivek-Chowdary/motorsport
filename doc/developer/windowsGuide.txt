############################################
You'll need to download certain libraries and programs in order to be able to compile motorsport.
I suggest you download the files to a common directory, such as c:\temp. I'll assume you'll use that directory for extracting zipped files.
############################################



############################################
STEPS:

1:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SUBVERSION:
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91
Download and execute the latest subversion installer
	svn-X.X.X-setup.exe
Execute it. install it wherever you want (click "next" all the time should work)
possibly reboot the computer, in order for the new PATH env. variable to take effect
You now have a working installation of subversion. We'll use it to download motorsport source code.

2:DOWNLOAD MOTORSPORT:
Open a new command line window
Create a new dir
	md \motorsport
	cd \motorsport
Download everything
	svn co svn://motorsport-sim.org/motorsport/trunk ./
If you do...
	dir
...you'll see 4 directories. We'll be working mainly in the 3pl (3rd Party Libraries) directory.


3:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL DEVCPP:
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
Download the latest Dev-C++ with mingw/GCC, for example
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp4990setup.exe
Execute it. clicking "next" all the time should make it install in
	c:\dev-cpp.
We're going to use some of devcpp's tools. These tools are located in
	c:\dev-cpp\bin
In order to use them, i suggest you add it to the path.
For example, in Windows9x, add this line to the c:\autoexec.bat file:
	set path=c:\dev-cpp\bin;%path%
Once you've done that, you'll have to reboot in order for it to take affect everywhere.

4:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SDL:
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
Download the latest development libraries for Win32. for example
	http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.7-mingw32.tar.gz
Extract its contents to c:\temp. You'll now have a new dir named:
	c:\temp\sdl-1.2.7
a) Copy...
	c:\temp\sdl-1.2.7\include
...contents to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\include
b) Copy...
	c:\temp\sdl-1.2.7\lib
...contents to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
c) Copy the...
	c:\temp\sdl-1.2.7\bin\sdl.dll
...file to:
	c:\motorsport\src\
We're now finished with SDL.

5:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ODE:
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?op=&cid=7
Download the 0.039, mingw version of ODE:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?cid=7&lid=32
Extract the file contents to c:\temp. You'llnow have a new dir named:
	c:\temp\libode-0.39-lib-mingw
a) Copy the 'ode' directory from...
	c:\temp\libode-0.39-lib-mingw\src\include
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\include
b) Copy the 'libode.a' and 'libode.def' files from...
	c:\temp\libode-0.39-lib-mingw\lib
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
Now we're almost done with ODE.

6:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL OGRE, FREETYPE, AND FINISH ODE:
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=5
Download the ogre-0.14-mingw.DevPak:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?cid=5&lid=5
Rename the file from...
	ogre-0.14-mingw.DevPak
to:
	ogre-0.14-mingw.tar.rar
Extract its contents to c:\temp.
Extract its contents to c:\temp using winrar.
IMPORTANT: you'll probably need to use winrar instead of winzip. I had :)
You'll now have 2 new dirs, and one new file in c:\temp.
a) Copy everything except 'plugins.cfg' from...
	c:\temp\ogre-0.14-mingw\bin
...to:
	c:\motorsport\src
Now we're done with ODE, and with part of Ogre.
b) Copy everything from...
	c:\temp\ogre-0.14-mingw\include
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\include
c) Copy everything from...
	c:\temp\ogre-0.14-mingw\lib
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
Now we're done with Ogre.
d) Copy freetype.dll from...
	c:\temp\ogre-0.14-mingw\bin
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
Now we're done with FreeType.

7:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL XERCES-C
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=5
Download the xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw devpack:
	http://the-agency.sourceforge.net/xoops/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?cid=5&lid=2
Rename the file from...
	xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw.DevPak
...to:
	xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw.tar.rar
Extract its contents to c:\temp using winrar.
You'll now have a new dir and a new file.
a)Copy the contents from...
	c:\temp\xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw\include
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\include
b)Copy all the contents from...
	c:\temp\xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw\lib
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
c)Copy the file 'xerces-c_2_5_0.dll' from...
	c:\temp\xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw\lib
...to:
	c:\motorsport\src
We still need some files. We're gonna have to take them from the MSVC version of xerces-c.
Open a browser and go to this page:
	http://apache.rediris.es/xml/xerces-c/binaries/win32
Download the xerces-c_2_5_0-windows_nt-msvc_60.zip:
	http://apache.rediris.es/xml/xerces-c/binaries/win32/xerces-c_2_5_0-windows_nt-msvc_60.zip
Extract its contents to c:\temp. You'll now have a new dir named:
	c:\temp\xerces-c_2_5_0-windows_nt-msvc_60
Now go to this directory...
	c:\temp\xerces-c_2_5_0-windows_nt-msvc_60\include\xercesc\util
...and copy the 21 '*.c' files in it (no need to browse the subdirectories) to...
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\include\xercesc\util

8:DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL PTHREADS:
Open a browser or ftp client and go here:
	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32
Download the latest *.exe file. For example:
	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-2004-06-22.exe
Execute it in order to extract its contents to c:\temp.
You'll now have 3 new dirs in c:\temp.
Copy all the *GC*.* files from...
	c:\temp\Pre-built\lib
...to:
	c:\motorsport\3pl\windows\lib
We have finished with PTHREADS now.

9:DONE!!!
Well, that has been the installation of all the required libs and mosp sources.
If you are using GNU/Linux, for example Gentoo, you ca do all the above with something like this:
	emerge ogre ode sdl subversion
	mkdir ~/motorsport
	cd ~/motorsport
	svn co svn://motorsport-sim.org/motorsport/trunk ./

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN MOTORSPORT

Change to the motorsport source code dir:
	cd \motorsport\src
Delete previous object files (probably none at this time):
	make clean
Optionally, delete all the log and temporary files:
	make clobber
Compile and link the whole thing:
	make all
Execute it
	motorsport.exe
You can do all the last 4 steps at once:
	make clean clobber all run
(clobber will automatically execute the 'clean' target anyway)
############################################

That's it.
If you have a problem, if no one else can help,
and if you can find them, maybe you can browse...
the mosp forums at rscnet ;)
